        We are living in a time where irreversible damage to our environment is no longer something we can ignore. Fossil fuel use has been on the forefront of environmental news increasingly often. Kingston homes are reliant on damaging and unsustainable fossil fuels to keep us comfortable and warm. This includes resources such as propane, wood, natural gas, and electricity. With new technology and the spread of its availability there are more choices than ever for you to do your part, and make an environmentally friendly decision. <br>
        <br>
        We are spreading awareness for solar panels, specifically as options for the student housing district to minimize the environmental impact these (often large) properties have. We know it can be difficult to invest in upfront costs (though there may be government programs which can help), but the long term benefits are clear to see. Invest in your future, become educated in the options and facts, and contribute to a global movement towards a healthier planet.

          <h4 class="media-heading">Solar Initiatives</h4>
          <p>
            The Ontario Government has recently focused on the development of renewable resources. As a business owner, you can benefit hugely from their initiatives. The MicroFIT and FIT (Feed-In-Tariff) programs target individual homes and businesses to be fitted with solar panels at greatly reduced costs as well as huge savings on the cost of utilities and energy usage. <strong>Put money in your pockets while saving the planet!</strong>

          <h4 class="media-heading">Utilize FIT and MicroFIT</h4>
          <p>
            On average Ontario electricity consumers pay $0.19 to $0.20 per kWh for electricity (total bill amount/kWh used). Most houses in the University District fall in the 6kWh or smaller range, with only a few up to 10kWh (City of Kingston). As seen from the subsidies consumers receive every month, the benefits are huge and can actually serve as a source of income. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The province will also provide loans and subsidies for the installation of this technology, covering most of the costs for the solar units as well as the manual installation. The Province will also lock you into a low monthly rate on utilities used for a 25-year period. In times where energy prices seem to increase by the minute, this is a bargain!
