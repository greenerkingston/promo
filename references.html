            This page contains a list of academic articles, informative writing, and further information regarding the details of climate change, the prevention efforts that are underway, and the details of the programs discussed. Reading through will provide an in-depth overview of the subject matter, and allow for greater breadth when assessing the options.

        <p><strong>Source:</strong> Hansen, J. et al. “Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2℃ global warming could be dangerous”. 2016. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics 16:3761-3812. Doi: 10.5194/acp-16-3761-2016.</p>
        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> By implementing new modelling techniques revising previous studies, the future predictions from these results suggests that fossil fuel consumption is rapidly contributing to global warming and as little as a 2℃ increase will raise sea levels with devastating effects.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality of Evidence:</strong> This study took place over a 10 year period and updated the modelling techniques from previous studies, focused on the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, to more modern and precise models that yield highly accurate results. The study was very comprehensive and had a very large data set which allowed them to see that previous models were not up to today's standards for predictions. There is potentially a bias in the the original aim of the study was to prove the old modelling techniques wrong and speed up the timelines, which they did find in their results; however this may be magnified due to the preexisting belief of what they assumed they would find and wanting to urge people that the problem of climate change is serious. </p>

        <p><strong>Evidence: </strong>Solar power efficiency and utility consumption in the average city.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality of Evidence: </strong>This study focuses on the development of sustainable cities through the measurement of energy usage in cities across the world including Europe, Asia and North America. This was done through the measurement of production and consumption of energy and materials through cities and to individual households. Production level focused mainly on energy usage, material and emissions produced in a city’s boundaries, mainly electricity, water and natural gas. Consumption based approaches focused on households as well as resources consumed from the purchase of goods and services within the city. The collection was done through real time data collection through smart meters (adapted utility measurement meters). Limitations focused on costs, privatization of energy industries and meter types. This source speaks to the global utilization of solar energy as a renewable resource.</p>

    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> 50% less consumption of fossil fuel powered energy, same electricity consumption on solar power. </p>
    <p><strong>Quality of Evidence:</strong> The study was conducted by recruiting 425 households in Germany, half with solar, half without, through online questionnaire for 2014-2015. Answers were crossed checked with government sources on energy consumption rates of those households. Evidence was found for a distinction between households with photovoltaic solar(PV) installation before and after grid parity was achieved, especially concerning moderation effects of the economic framework.</p></div>

    <div class="main-source"><p><strong>Source:</strong> Armstrong, S. and W.G. Hurley. “A new methodology to optimise solar energy extraction under cloudy conditions”. 2010. Renewable Energy 35:780-787.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> The orientation and tilt of rooftop solar panels will maximize solar energy collection at specific latitudes and during incidences of increased cloud coverage. </p>
    <p><strong>Quality of Evidence:</strong> The authors completed studies of solar panels in all weather types and during all times of year in six locations. All solar panels were measured at different angles and then theoretical modeling in some locations took place in order to determine improved sun collection. The newly developed solar radiation was then tested in the Egypt location during all times of year and all types of weather. The study found that this model was not limited to overcast conditions or sunny conditions but improved overall energy collection. It serves as a demonstration of continually improving solar technology. </p></div>

    <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Fossil fuel production leads to long term, global damage of fragile ecosystems and has negative impacts on biodiversity hotspots due to habitat destruction and fragmentation of areas that would have been otherwise undistur</p>bed. 
    <p><strong>Quality of Evidence:</strong> This study aimed to compare biofuel production to fossil fuel production by updating existing models predicting areas of disturbance and abundance of fuels. They used effective figures to illustrate the comparisons on a global scale and had convincing data about the obvious destructive nature of fossil-fuel production. The tone in this article could at times be very heavy handed in the condemning of fossil-fuels in clear favour of biofuels. The information could have been presented more evenly in the comparison to remove personal bias, however the facts and figures redeemed the language of the paper.</p></div>
